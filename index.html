                    <li> The game has four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue. </li>
                    <li> I will create a sequence of colors that players must repeat by pressing the buttons in the same order. </li>
                    <li> Each time a player correctly repeats the sequence, I will add another color to the sequence. </li>
                    <li> If a player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button, the game is over. </li>
                    <li> Players must repeat the pattern by memory, and cannot rely on a visual cue to help them. </li>
                    <li> The game gets progressively harder as the number of colors in the sequence increases. </li>
                    <li> The goal is to get the highest score possible by creating the longest sequence without making a mistake. </li>
